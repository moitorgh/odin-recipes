## Project Status
***This project is no longer actively maintained***.

_I might not be improving all the other recipe webpages to resemble the look and feel of the index page. This is mainly because of two reasons: firstly, [it is important to focus on the task at hand and keep moving through the curriculum](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56), and secondly, [projects in the foundations course aren't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/strategically-building-your-portfolio-1km4)._

## Setup & Usage

### Setup
Fork and `git clone` the **odin-recipes** repository to get a local copy.

### Usage
Either view the [live demo](https://moitorgh.github.io/odin-recipes/) or open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Self Reflections
This is the first project in the Foundations course.

I practiced my basic HTML chops which included stuff like the HTML boilerplate (i.e., the DOCTYPE and the elements html, head, meta, title, body etc.) along with other elements and documentaions for headings, paragraphs, bold and italicized, nesting and indentation, ordered and unordered lists, links and images, git commit messages, writing READMEs, and build and deployment using github-pages.

I also added CSS to change the look and style of the website. Some of the techniques that I utilized were the usage of a universal selector, type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, grouping selectors, chaining selectors, descendant combinator, several CSS properties (particular the use of web fonts and generic fonts), CSS cascade, specificity, inheritance, and rule order.

Furthermore, I improved upon the previous CSS by utilizing the newly learned CSS box model. I also used a gif to make it look pleasant and completely revamped the index page from earlier iterations.

## Future Additions
- [x] Style it up with CSS
- [x] Improve index page using CSS box model
- [ ] Improve all webpages using CSS box model
- [ ] Give sources in the acknowledgements section
- [x] Write a comprehensive and well documented README
