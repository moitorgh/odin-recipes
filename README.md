## Description
`odin-recipes` is a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

It is a basic recipe website that consists of a main index page which has links to three recipes. It won't look pretty unless you're into [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/).

## Self-Reflection
Nothing really significant to add here! This is the first project in the Foundations course. I practiced my basic HTML chops which included stuff like the HTML boilerplate (i.e., the DOCTYPE and the elements like html, head, meta, title, body etc.) and other elements for headings, paragraphs, making text bold and italicized, nesting and indentation, ordered and unordered lists, links and images, git commit messages, writing READMEs, and build and deployment using github-pages.

## Future Additions
Following features might be added in the project:
- [ ] Style it up with CSS
